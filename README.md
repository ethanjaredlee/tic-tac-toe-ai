# tic-tac-toe-ai

A quick project of a tic-tac-toe ai that will always win or tie the game using the minimax algorithm.
Running this Python file in the command line will prompt the game on the command line. The player moves first choosing a value between 0 and 8 corresponding to the following spaces on the board:
| 0 | 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 | 5 |
| 6 | 7 | 8 |
The game will not work properly if a player chooses a spot that is already occupied or inputs anything that is not an integer between 0 and 8.
